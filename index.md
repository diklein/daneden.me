Hi I’m David Klein, and I’m a designer. When I was 6 years old professional baseball star Will Clark called me a “dirtbag.” 

For any 6 year old that’s hard to take. But, even though a young child’s baseball ambition died face down in the mud that day, another dream was born in its place. I vowed that from that day forth, whatever I did, I would be the best I could. It’s this that spurs me on to be a great designer, to exceed expectations, to hit it out the park, so that one glorious day, when I run into Will Clark again, I can whip out my portfolio and say triumphantly “Hey Will, remember me? No? Err... Ok... Well... Do you need a website designed or anything?”

My passion for perfection filters into one of my other interests - coffee. I know a lot of people say they love coffee. But I’m obsessed with it. I spend an inordinate amount of time experimenting with beans, grinding equipment and brewing methods to in my attempt to make the perfect cup of Joe. I write regularly about coffee and my other interests over at my [blog](/blog).

Thanks for checking out my website. I hope you’ll stimulate your senses by taking a look at my portfolio. If you have any thoughts, questions or recommendations I’d love to hear from you.

Especially if your name’s Will Clark.
